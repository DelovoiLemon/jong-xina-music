# Miku-DiscordMusicBot
A discord bot that plays music from youtube and local files and can also normalize audio

Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

In the config.json file insert your discord bot token into "token", your prefered bot prefix into "prefix" (add a space to the end for cleaner commands)

"normalize" determines if miku will normalize the audio played, set to true to enable

In the same directory as miku.js, run "npm install", then "node miku.js". 

Then, in discord, type [Your prefix]"set channel" to set the channel for miku to listen for commands from.
